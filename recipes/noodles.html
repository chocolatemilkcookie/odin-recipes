        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Noodles</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Soy sauce (optional)</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

            <li>Place your noodles of choice in your sufuria and add water until fully covered</li>
            <li>Turn the heat on and wait for the water to boil for around a minute</li>
            <li>Taste a strand of the noodle to check on the texture, ensuring that it is not hard and undercooked</li>
            <li>As soon as your preferred texture is attained, lower the heat and drain 70% of the water. <strong>Do not dispose off of the noodle water</strong></li>

            <li>Once fully mixed, begin to reintroduce the noodle water little by little while tasting, ensuring not to dilute the ramen</li>
            <li>When the soup remaining is to your liking, turn off the gas and serve together with the boiled eggs</li>
        </ol>
